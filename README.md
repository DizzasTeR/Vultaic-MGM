So good that even FFS decided to use its garage and features!
Our MGM is home for multiple clans now who never had a server or used default race!

Q: Why we decided to publicly release this?

Ans:

MTA staff is a joke, your scripts are not safe if you use luac.mtasa.com, anyone can go up to MTA team and cry over to them and get your scripts uncompiled and leaked, or if you're someone like -ffs-Sniper with alot of money, you can just make people like Dutchman your puppet.

Our scripts were uncompiled by Dutchman although we never sold the ownerhip rights, just a copy of these scripts and therefore people were selling our scripts randomly between each other, so we decided to rather have it publicly available than people pay randos for it.
